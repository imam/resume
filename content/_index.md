# Careers

## Freelance and Teaching On Own Startup, KelasKoding.xyz (2016 - Present)

I enjoy being a professional developer in another company, but currently before I made the consideration to go back to employment, I choose to teach coding as a living. I've teached privately and on group, while keeping up-to-date with current technology. 

Most of the time I run ads on Facebook to find students,and currently I'm running a subscription based online course on [KelasKoding.xyz](KelasKoding.xyz). This site is made with Next.js framework, Cosmis.js for headless CMS, Auth0 for auth, Xendit for payment gateway (Stripe isn't really supported in Indonesia)

I did several freelancing here and there as well sometimes, hence you can read my experience about how I currently managed to create a quick prototype for any project below.

## Sribulancer (January - September 2018)

It's a site very similar to Freelancer.com that cater Indonesian's freelancers and businessess.

Assigned as backend engineer and product management. My works:

- Contributed on several NodeJs microservices creation (chat, job, offer, etc.)
- Contributed to a NodeJs RabbitMq library named amqphelp
- Gave suggestions for the development team workflow (Giving Trello a go, how to get better at managing with Trello, etc.)
- Gave suggestions on infrastructure to ease future development (To give vagrant a chance, several suggestions for the flow of the development, etc.)
- Helping on improvement, and bug fixing in Sribulancer's Ruby on Rails environment
- Helping on several employee onboardings, and try to improve the experience as easy as possible with my DevOps knowledge in Vagrant
- Contributing on Sribulancer's analytic data using Mixpanel's and Google Analytic's platform
- Helping on building better workflow for product and development team
- Research on Trello to see what features that we can leverage to better our workflow process

# My Workflow

## How Do I Start A Project?

For quick boilerplate for any project, I currently use Next.js (React server-side), Auth0 for quick authentication, then use Vercel for deployment.

For database, I use Prisma with MySQL, then for CMS, if creating a customized one isn't really needed, I would use a Headless CMS such as Cosmic.js or Contentful. It's a lot faster than creating customized one and a lot more flexible, the client can ask any additional field on a model and it can be added in no time!

If the requirement require a mobile app, I use React's Material UI with Capacitor.js (Framework that can simply use HTML, CSS, and Javascript to deploy a simple mobile app. Not the best choice for long term project, but a great one for scaffolding quick ideas)

Whenever I have any progress, I would use my Vultr VPS (Ubuntu) to expose the project.

## My Editor

I love to use Visual Studio Code with Remote Development that I connect to my private Vultr VPS. I too use NeoVim on my VPS occcasionally when the project scopes are small (you can check my bashrc on [https://gist.github.com/imam/83b28c67c7fdf8b387da706d9ed32994](https://gist.github.com/imam/83b28c67c7fdf8b387da706d9ed32994) ).

## Why Do I Use Vultr VPS For Development?

- Most of the time, their internet connection (far) exceed mine, really useful to scaffold any NPM projects or Laravel
- Easy to share any progress to my client, mostly I use Apache that forward any subdomain request to an exposed port for said project.

# Tech Stack
Below are listed several of my tech experiences (but not limited to), in no particular order:

## Backend

### Node.js
Express, Koa, Jest, Storyboard, etc.

### Golang

### Ruby on Rails

### Python

### PHP
Laravel, Symfony, PHPUnit, etc.

### Frontend Techs
Cypress, Parcel, Webpack, etc.

### Vue.js
Vuex, etc.

## React
Next.js, React Redux, MobX, etc.

## DevOps Tools

### Buddy.works
I use Buddy.works, because even if I can try to work through something like Jenkins or CircleCI, my nature of having to develop fast as a developer (I rarely have to think about scalability) made me have to stay on the simplicity of Buddy.

### Docker

### Vercel, Netlify, Github Pages, Heroku

## Others

### Git

### Tailwind

### Unix

### AWS

### Algolia
