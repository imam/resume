# Hello, My Name Imam Assidiqqi

I'm a highly motivated self-taught software engineer since 2015.

# My Workflow

## How Do I Start A Project?

For quick boilerplate, I currently use Next.js (React server-side), Auth0 for quick authentication, then use Vercel for deployment.

If the requirement require a mobile app, I use React's Material UI with Capacitor.js (Framework that can simply use HTML, CSS, and Javascript to deploy a simple mobile app. Not the best choice for long term project, but a great one for scaffolding quick ideas)



## My Editor

I love to use Visual Studio Code with Remote Development that I connect to my private Vultr VPS. I too use NeoVim on my VPS occcasionally when the project scopes are small (you can check my bashrc on [https://gist.github.com/imam/83b28c67c7fdf8b387da706d9ed32994](https://gist.github.com/imam/83b28c67c7fdf8b387da706d9ed32994) ).

### Why Do I Use Vultr VPS For Development?

- Most of the time, their internet connection (far) exceed mine, really useful to scaffold any NPM projects or Laravel
- Easy to share any progress to my client, mostly I use Apache that forward any subdomain request to an exposed port for said project.
